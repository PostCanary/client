        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>4) Customer Data; Ownership &amp; License</h2>
          <p>
            As between the parties, Customer owns all right, title, and interest in and to Customer Data and Output. {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} owns the Service, its software, models, templates, and all related intellectual property.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>License to Process.</strong> Customer grants {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, copy, process, transmit, and display Customer Data and Output solely to provide, maintain, secure, and support the Service and to prevent or address service, security, or technical issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Aggregates.</strong> {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} may create, use, and disclose Aggregated/De-identified Data for analytics, benchmarking, and to improve and develop the Service, provided it does not identify Customer or disclose Customer's Confidential Information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Retention &amp; Deletion.</strong> Except as required by law, {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} will retain Customer Data only for as long as needed to provide the Service and as stated in these Terms.

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>5) Confidentiality</h2>
          <p>
            "Confidential Information" means non-public information disclosed by either party that is marked or reasonably understood to be confidential, including Customer Data, Output, and non-public product information.
          </p>
          <p>
            A party will (a) use the other party's Confidential Information only to perform under these Terms; (b) not disclose it to third parties except to its personnel and subprocessors who need to know and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective; and (c) protect it using commercially reasonable safeguards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exclusions include information that is public without breach, already known without restriction, independently developed, or rightfully received from a third party. A party may disclose Confidential Information when required by law with reasonable prior notice (if legally permitted). These obligations survive 3 years (trade secrets for as long as protected by law).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>6) Data Protection; Processing of Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} acts as a service provider/processor with respect to personal information contained in Customer Data and will process it only on Customer's documented instructions to provide the Service; {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} will not "sell" or "share" such personal information as those terms are defined under applicable privacy laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} will impose equivalent obligations on its subprocessors and provide reasonable assistance to Customer for responding to privacy rights requests and meeting legal obligations proportionate to the Service. A separate Data Processing Addendum ("DPA") forms part of these Terms and is incorporated by reference.
          </p>

          <h2>7) Security &amp; Incident Notice</h2>
          <p>
            {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} implements administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect Customer Data, including encryption in transit and access controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            If {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} becomes aware of unauthorized access to Customer Data in its possession, it will notify Customer without undue delay and provide information reasonably available to assist Customer in meeting any legal obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customer is responsible for securing its systems, devices, and Authorized User access (including strong passwords and role-based access).
          </p>

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>8) Acceptable Use &amp; Prohibited Data</h2>
          <p>Customer will not, and will not permit any third party to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>use the Service in violation of law;</li>
            <li>upload or process Sensitive Data, including protected health information (PHI), payment card data, government IDs (e.g., SSNs), biometric templates, or children's data;</li>

          <h2>9) Third-Party Services &amp; Subprocessors</h2>
          <p>
            The Service may interoperate with or rely on third-party services (e.g., authentication, payments). Use of third-party services may be subject to their own terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} uses subprocessors to provide the Service; a current list of material subprocessors will be made available at a "Subprocessors" page and may be updated from time to time. {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} will provide advance notice of material changes and, where required, a reasonable opportunity to object; if an objection cannot be resolved, Customer may terminate the affected Service as its sole remedy.
          </p>

        <section class="terms-section">

            <strong>Fees.</strong> The Service is offered on subscription plans that may include usage-based components (for example, mail pieces or records processed). Prices, features, and limits are described at checkout or in an order document.

          </p>
          <p>
            THE SERVICE AND OUTPUT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED, {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>14) Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Customer Indemnity.</strong> Customer will defend and indemnify {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} and its affiliates against third-party claims arising from Customer Data, Customer's use of the Service in violation of law or these Terms, or Customer's marketing communications or practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>{{ BRAND.legalEntity }} Indemnity.</strong> {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} will defend and indemnify Customer against third-party claims alleging that the Service, as provided by {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} to Customer, infringes any U.S. intellectual-property right, and will (at its option) procure rights, modify, or replace the Service to resolve the claim. If none is commercially reasonable, {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} may terminate the affected portion of the Service and refund prepaid fees for the terminated portion.
          </p>
          <p>
            This section does not apply to claims arising from Customer Data, combinations not provided by {{ BRAND.legalEntity }}, or use outside the scope of these Terms. These are the parties' sole and exclusive remedies for such IP claims.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>15) Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY.
          </p>
          <p>
            EXCEPT FOR (A) A PARTY'S IP INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS, (B) WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR (C) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, EACH PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>16) Term; Suspension; Termination; Data Return/Deletion</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Term.</strong> These Terms apply from account creation or first use and continue until terminated.
          </p>
          <p>

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>17) Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>
          <p>
            {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} may make commercially reasonable changes to the Service. For material changes to these Terms, {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} will provide at least 30 days' advance notice, and the changes will take effect at the next renewal. If Customer objects, Customer may terminate before the effective date; continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>18) Governing Law; Dispute Resolution; Class Waiver</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota, excluding conflicts-of-law rules. Any dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration under the AAA Commercial Rules by a single arbitrator seated in Minneapolis, MN. Either party may seek individual relief in small-claims court with jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. You may opt out of arbitration by sending written notice to {{ BRAND.email.support }} within 30 days of first acceptance of these Terms.

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>19) DMCA (If You Host User Content)</h2>
          <p>
            If the Service allows users to post content publicly (e.g., forums), {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} will designate a DMCA agent and follow the notice-and-takedown process. Details will be published on the site.

        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>20) Force Majeure</h2>
          <p>

          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>21) Assignment</h2>
          <p>
            Either party may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets, provided the assignee is not a direct competitor and assumes all obligations. Other assignments require the other party's consent, not unreasonably withheld.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>22) Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence; Waiver; Severability</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms (together with any order document, the DPA, and policies referenced herein, including any Acceptable Use Policy and Privacy Policy) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements regarding the Service. In case of conflict, an order document prevails over these Terms. Failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver. If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>23) Notices</h2>
          <p>
            Notices must be sent by email to {{ BRAND.email.support }} and are deemed given when sent (customer notices to {{ BRAND.legalEntity }}) or when {{ BRAND.legalEntity }} posts within the Service or sends to the email on Customer's account (notices to Customer). Legal notices and DMCA notices should be addressed as specified on the site.
